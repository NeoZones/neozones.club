Ricky the raccoon is the mascot of NeoZones. He is diagnosed with rabies and terminal baby disease. Before his job at NeoZones, Ricky was often found at a dumpster behind a local WalMart suffering from a cocaine addiction. He may look like a cute baby raccoon, but Ricky has a criminal record to his name including charges of vandalism, arson, and drug possession. However, he has claimed to be sober since then.</p></article><br>

<h2><a href="/~bytemoth/">Bytemoth</a></h2>
<p><img width=252 height=252 src="bytemoth.png" class=fl alt="" title="LIKE A BOSS">
Bytemoth is said to have emerged, fully formed, from the same puff of logic that obliterated Yahweh in 2012. He claims to be a digital warlock with dominion over many strange magickal realms, including a text-based forest, a cosmic dungeon with 5000 levels, and an <a href="//bytemoth.neocities.org/">'electric brook'</a>.</p>
<p>
He was last seen attempting to use forbidden technomancy powers to revive the year 2009. As of the time of writing, he appears to be trapped within a temporal dilation vortex, resulting in the current glacial pace of updates to his websites and blogs.</p>

&#xD6;wly, also known as Cass Python, has been eating ass since the day they was born, yes that's right, since 2008 they has been showing the world that it doesn't matter what size your penis is, all that matters is how well you eat dat @$$.</p>
<p>
They have an interest in computers, 90's websites, collecting records, and the preservation of the World Wide Web. &#xD6;wly also runs their <a href="//owlman.neocities.org/">own website</a> where they post about a large amount of topics and themes.</p>
<p>
Cass Python was arrested on 2018-12-25, and they are currently under investigation by the Home Office due to their relation to David Spencer, who was charged for planing the 1982 Trumpton Riots, where 16 people, including Captain Snort were killed. Python, 63, was arrested after a long fire out with the police on Tuesday.</p>
<p>
They could face charges of second-degree murder, over 16 cases, along with owning a firearm without a licence, refusing arrest, and attempted murder of the police force while refusing to be arrested.</p>
