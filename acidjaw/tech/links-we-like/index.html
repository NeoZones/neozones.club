<p>
Damn.</p>
<p>
The page also talks about a bootleg album called "<em>Elvis' Greatest Shit</em>" (charming), an album that is an "album consisting largely of outtakes and a selection of Elvis' movie soundtrack songs of the 1960s, which was deliberately made to highlight the worst of his career". The album is so classy, the album cover even has a real photo of Elvis in an open casket, like fuck.</p></td>

As late 2014, there were changes that allowed gay and bisexual men to donate their blood if they had sex within the past three months. <a href="https://www.blood.co.uk/who-can-give-blood/men-who-have-sex-with-men/">To quote the NHS website</a>; "Using protection like a condom can reduce this risk, but it doesn't eliminate it. [...] That is why we can't collect blood from men who have had oral or anal sex with men, with or without protection, in the last 3 months. This isn't meant to be discriminatory. It's not based on anyone's sexual history or sexuality. It reflects statistical risks for the sexual behaviour that increases the risk of virus transmission."
