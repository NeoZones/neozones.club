Please turn your immediate attention to <b>CETX (Cemtrex Inc.)</b> trading on
 the Nasdaq</p><p>
With big name clients such as Boeing, United Airlines, Tyco, and the U.S.
 Custom and Border Protection Agency, we are shocked to see <b>CETX</b> was
 trading at less than $2.00 a share. Low float of just 6.84M, registered a
 decrease of 14.27% in short interest, $13M worth in new orders for the upcoming
 quarter, an impressive list of Fortune 500 clients, strong Q4 Numbers, no
 insider selling within the last 12-months</p><p>
Despite its tremendous growth potential, and the signing of huge deals like
 the one we saw earlier this month, <b>CETX</b> is still trading well off its
 52-week high of $3.57.</p><p>About <b>Cemtrex</b>:</p><p>
<b>Cemtrex, Inc. (CETX)</b> is the manufacturer of the SmartDesk, the world's
 most advanced workstation. <b>CETX</b> is a diversified technology company

2019-06-20 19:18<br>From: Surge Holdings, Inc &lt;noreply@surg.tk&gt;<br>
X-Spam-score: 17.7<hr><div style="font:normal small/1.1 Cambria"><p>
OTCQB: <b>$SURG</b> is a revenue machine that has over 68 Million in assets,
 1.6 Million cash in the bank and 1.4 Million in monthly recurring revenue</p>
<p>Surge receives an MOU commitment of 40,000 new store locations utilizing the
 SurgePays Blockchain SaaS portal with a commitment of $1,500 per month in
 sales per location.</p><p>
<b>Surge Holdings, Inc. ($SURG)</b>, a publicly-traded company offering wireless, 
telecom, payment services, and an industry-changing virtual wholesale distr
ibution portal for retailers, is capitalizing by focusing on the 77 million
 Americans with no contract cell phones, and the 51% of the population that
 has below grade, or invisible credit.</p><p>
<b>Surge Holdings</b> utilizes emerging technology to improve the quality of life 
for these millions of people who are unbanked, under-banked or often overlooked.
 This budget-conscious demographic typically does not want to be locked into
 contracts and regularly will cash their checks and pay bills at the over
 300,000+ corner stores, markets, and bodegas near their homes multiple
 times each week.This broad and underserved market is where the Surge Holdings
 plan provides a competitive advantage to grab fantastic market share.</p><p>
<b>SURG</b> utilizes their proprietary SurgePays Blockchain Portal to create a
 distribution railway into these stores. The basic service, topping off payments
 to other carriers, allows stores to offer new and existing customers a pathway
 for the payments they need, like paying virtually any cell phone carrier with
 cash.</p><p>
<b>SURG</b> then bundles other wireless services, wireless phone sales,
 municipal government payments, pre-paid debit cards branded with the big three:
 MasterCard/Visa/Discover.</p><p>
One of the most excited, potentially game-changing opportunities within the
 SurgePays portal, is that it allows for the decision makers at thousands of
 retailers to be marketed to directly for the wholesale distribution of
 additional products for their stores. Opening the door for Surge to distribute
 wholesale consumables such as energy drinks, CBD oils, snacks, and anything
 else that might appeal to their specific customer base. This direct access to
 the owners of the nation&#039;s countless, hard to reach "mom and pop" stores
 removes the need for a national sales force to bring products to their
 attention. Now the stores can research and purchase products directly 
through the SurgePays Portal. The retailer orders their products, Surge
 processes the payment and issues the purchase order, and then the vendor
 dropships the products directly to the retailer. </p><p>
A recent independent research report for <b>Surge Holdings, Inc.</b> stated,
 "the key metric for investors: an estimated $1.5M in monthly revenue per 1,000
 stores, which should be continually replicated with greater sales penetration
 over time. The most recent shareholder update stated a target of 15,000 retail
 locations by year-end 2019. This estimate equates to $22.5 million per month
 in topline revenue. Current revenues are approximately 
$1.4 million a month, so this is 16x, or a 1,600% increase.</p><p>
<b>SURG</b> is also endorsed as a preferred wireless and payment provider for
 both government and private associations alike. One of the most recent examples
 is the Oklahoma Grocer's Association endorsement, which was for 2,000
 convenience stores.</p><p>
With over 154,000 convenience stores throughout the United States -- not
including grocery stores, liquor stores or other potential distribution
 locations, we are talking less than 10% market penetration for a management
 team who has grown this same type of service to over $17 million a month as a
 private company, and before offering prepaid wireless.</p><p>
The <b>SURG</b> team led by CEO, Brian Cox has generated hundreds of millions
 in annual revenue in private companies. Now in the public sector, his model for
 business building over the last 18 years has proven a success. It is
 based on the rock of recurring revenue from life-enhancing technology products
 and lifting people up. He is continuing to do that now in Surge. By building
 an OTCQB up to the big board so that shareholders who believe in the
 company now can take the profit ride up with the company!</p><p>
When was the last time you saw a company where revenue led price by this much?
 When was the last time you saw an OTCQB with earnings and such a power team?
 <b>SURG</b> is it!</p></div><hr><hr>

 oppressed by the horrendous and violent Chinese Communist Party. Please support

<p><big>5. We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this decadent Communist society. We want education that teaches us our true history and our role in the present day society.</big></p>
<p><big>6. We want an immediate end to POLICE BRUTALITY Hong Kong people. Right to bear arms for all Hong Kong people over the age of 18 to protect ourselves from the brutal police.</big></p>
<p><big>7. We want freedom for all Hong Kong people held in prisons and jails.</big></p>

<p><big>The Black Panther Party (BPP), originally the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, was a revolutionary political organization founded by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton in October 1966 in Oakland, California. The party was active in the United States from 1966 until 1982, with chapters in numerous major cities, and international chapters operating in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, and in Algeria from 1969 until 1972.</big></p>
<p><big>Scholars have characterized the Black Panther Party as the most influential black movement organization of the late 1960s, and "the strongest link between the domestic Black Liberation Struggle.</big></p>
<p><big>We are establishing the Black Panthers Hong Kong organization to fix the terrible treatment of people in Hong Kong since the invasion of the People's Republic of China.</big></p>
<p><big>We will create the first group to militantly fight for Hong Kong human rights and independence from the fascist state of People's Republic of China. We will do anything and everything to gain political, economic, and social power for people everywhere in Hong Kong. No more "soft and nice" tactics of the pacifist left and liberal elite. We will use powerful tactics and strong actions and demands, to force the government and people to give real power back to Hong Kong people, and enhance their status as the true owners of Hong Kong.</big></p>
<p><big>We will follow closely the ten-point-program of the original Black Panther Party in the USA</big></p>
<p><big>1. We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our Hong Kong Community.</big></p>
<p><big>2. We want full democracy for our people.</big></p>
<p><big>3. We want an end to the robbery by the Communist People's Republic of China of our Hong Kong Community.</big></p>

<h3>ZA Group, Inc. (Stock Symbol: ZAAG) Operates in the High Revenue Growth
 Medical Marijuana Business Sector</h3> 
<ul style="font-weight:bold">
<li>Holding Company Focused on High Value Acquisitions.</li>
<li>Medical Marijuana Subsidiary with Two Established Ventures in Canada.</li>
<li>Plans to Pay Dividends to ZAAG Shareholders.</li>
<li>First Nations Sovereign Rights Provide Growth and Development Benefits
 Including Tax-Free Status.</li>
</ul>
<p>ZA Group, Inc. (ZAAG) is a holding company targeting the acquisition of undervalued, niche companies with high growth potential, income-producing investments designed to pay a dividend to ZAAG shareholders.</p> 
<p>ZAAG is currently involved, through its subsidiary, Econic Crop Solutions, Inc. in services for the rapidly developing Medical Marijuana industry in Canada. ZAAG has acquired a controlling interest of 60% in Econic Crop Solutions which builds and supplies indoor farming modules to grow and extract cannabis products for domestic and export markets. These systems include the portable structures that house the production grow pods, the grow pod equipment itself, and finally the product extraction facilities. ZAAG also supplies and operates the on-site dispensaries which package and sell the end products through on-site sales as well as to export customers.</p>
<p>Under ZAAG management, Econic operates a 15,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Red Deer, Alberta which serves as the company's manufacturing, assembly, and distribution center for the equipment and resources that it supplies for the above ventures. This facility also provides retail purchase and shipping services for grow equipment, lighting systems for the wider indoor farming community, seed hybrid sales, nutrient systems as well as agronomic consulting services.</p>
<p>Econic has joint venture agreements in place to provide these services to three First Nations communities in western Canada and similar business discussions are actively underway for several more with many to follow soon.</p>
<ul><li><h4>Successful Completion of Second Pilot Business Venture Located at the Louis Bull Cree Nation in Central Alberta, Canada</h4></li></ul>
<p>On January 14<sup>th</sup>ZAAG announced the successful completion of its second pilot business venture under the Econic Corp Solutions division, located at the Louis Bull Cree Nation in central Alberta, Canada. The Louis Bull Cree Nation administers a land area of 20 square miles with a population of approximately 2400 people. It is the only First Nations government in Canada that occupies an official position at the United Nations.</p>
<p>ZAAG subsidiary Econic supplies and operates indoor farming modules to grow and extract Cannabis products for domestic and export markets. The Louis Bull venture is the second $100,000 capital project totally funded by Econic with harvest of the first crop expected at the end of February, 2021. Based on field observations by the growers, the revenues from this first crop from a single grow pod are expected to match the capital investment of $100,000.</p>
<p>As a result, all parties to the business venture are now making plans to secure and install a total of 100 such grow pods at this location along with a stand-alone extraction plant.</p> 
<ul><li><h4>Successful Completion of First Pilot Business Venture with the Nosim's Group of the Samson Cree Nation</h4></li></ul>
<p>On January 7thZAAG announced the successful completion of its first pilot business venture with the Nosim's Group of the Samson Cree Nation in Central Alberta, Canada. Samson Cree Nation administers a land area of 50 square miles with a population of approximately 3500 residents.</p>
<p>The first harvest at this installation is planned for the end of January with expected revenue of $100,000 from the crop. Because of the success achieved, final discussions are underway to quadruple the number of grow pods at Samson in the short term with expectation for future expansion to 100 grow pods.</p>
<p>Additionally, the training, employment and career development programs that arise from this ZAAG venture will also attract further outside funding to expand additional possibilities. The  companys First Nations sovereign rights status provides significant business growth and development benefits including tax-free status.</p>

 niche.</p>

<p>Good Day,</p>
<p>This letter is intended to inform you that we have completed a thorough
 investigation of a transaction, or should we say, a contract, that we conducted
 with the Libyan oil corporation. As a result, we trust that you will assist us
 in receiving a contract dividend of US$16,102,000.00. (Sixteen Million, One
 Hundred and Two Thousand United States Dollars).</p>
<p>Through UNH Oil Angola, we conducted a deal of crude oil supply based on a
 license issued by the Libyan Oil Cooperation, however, we later discovered that
 the permit holder was not the rightful owner.</p>
<p>Please do not disregard this communication.</p>
<p>UNH OIL Angola is required to report any unclaimed funds for permanent
 closure. Since I am an executive of UNH OIL Angola, I have access to all
 essential information and necessary contacts to ensure that the funds can be
 claimed without any difficulties.</p>
<p>UNH OIL Angola has deposited funds in escrow in anticipation of receiving
 legitimate claims for disbursement. Since I was fortunate enough to acquire
 this information, I believe it could be the key to achieving lifetime success
 without taking any risks. I can be reached via private email at [REDACTED], or
 by telephone at +244 [REDACTED].</p>
<p>I will not disclose any further information until we receive confirmation
 that we are in communication with the appropriate party.</p>
