 when you're temporarily upset."
<p>"Most people are more comfortable with old problems
 than with new solutions."</p>
<p>"Broken bones will mostly mend,
 but words will hurt until the end."</p>
<p>"Thousands of years ago, cats were worshipped as gods.
 Cats have never forgotten this."</p> 
<p>"Once you hate someone, everything they do is offensive: 'Look
 at this bitch eating those crackers like she owns the place.'"</p>
<p>"1/3 of me: I want a relationship so much, relationships are so cute<br>

 abolish that society.</p>

 is indistinguishable from malice.</p>
<p>"I am against swimming. It's gross and unhealthy and unnatural.
 If humans were meant to swim - whether in pools, oceans, or
 lakes - we would have fins.<br>
Swimming goes against my personal, abstract beliefs. Therefore,
 I will stop at nothing until swimming is banned for everyone.
 I also believe the government should stay out of our lives,
 unless there is something I don't like, then I want the
 government to make it illegal. I'm better than you if you
 think otherwise."</p>
<blockquote><p>"Right now, it is raining methane on Titan. The planet Uranus,
 apparently trying to live up to its name, is orbiting the sun
 sideways, while Venus spins backwards. There are stars
 exploding, black holes gorging, galaxies colliding.</p><p>
And here we sit, on a planet pock-marked by collisions, rocked
 by earthquakes, shaken by storms. A planet doomed to be fried
 in radiation as its magnetic fields collapse, until finally the
 sun grows into a red giant and leaves nothing of the Earth but
 dust.</p><p>
Here we sit, glasses on our noses, inhalers in our pockets,
 braces on our teeth, waiting to die as our heart muscle
 expires, our cells decide to grow forever, or a blood vessel
 just pops, and sometimes in unnatural ways, too.</p><p>
Here we sit, and some of us say, behold, look at the
 ORDER of it all."</p></blockquote></div></fieldset>

 can't be truely good, 'til we have been a little bad"<br>-Nan Witcomb</p>

 little like expecting the bull not to attack you because you are a
 vegetarian."<br>-Dennis Wholey</p>
<p>"It is more important to know where you are going than to get there quickly.
 Do not mistake activity for achievement. Remember that there is nothing stable
 in human affairs, therefore avoid undue elation in prosperity, or undue
 depression in adversity."<br>-Isocrates</p>
<p>"Have you ever noticed? Anybody going slower than you is an idiot, and anyone
 going faster than you is a maniac."<br>-George Carlin</p>
<p>"The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the opposite

 media?<br><b>&lt;Thellere#1337&gt;</b> Yep, he's not wrong<br>
 <b>&lt;Greed#6618&gt;</b> tbh I'd also add on his little talk a bit<br>
 and say social media also cheapens human interaction<br>
 and forces a weird blend of detached and involved<br>
 which isn't good for mental health<br>
 <b>&lt;Thellere#1337&gt;</b> Yep<br> I'd argue that's why interactions are so..
 intense? On some sites because folks realise that on some level and
 overcompensate the fuck out of it for the detachment part</p>

Faith/Religion</legend><div>
"Man, in his arrogance, thinks himself a great work, worthy of the
 interposition of a diety."<br>-Carl Sagan
<p>"You do not need the bible to justify love, but no better tool has been
 invented to justify hate."<br>-Richard Weatherwax</p>
<p>"Hell is a myth created by people in surrounding regions and it is a threat,
 there is no love in Christianity, sin is a man-made construct and the bible is
 full of contradictions, barbaric practices and is entirely plagarised from
 every other religion that had contact with the Isrealites. Get your facts
 straight before you sprout garbage."<br>-Griffin9857</p>
<p>"We seem to crave privelege. Merited not by our works, but by our birth; by
 the mere fact, that, say, we're humans, and born on Earth. We might call it the
 anthropocentric - the human-centered conceit. This conceit is brought close to
 culmination in the notion that we are created in god's image. The creator and
 ruler of the entire universe.. looks just like me. My, what a coincidence! How
 convenient and satisfying!"<br>-Carl Sagan</p>
<p>The Christians would like us to believe that they're acting out of concern
 for "religious freedom" or fighting back against a secular attack. Let's be
 utterly clear: if there is in fact a war on Christianity, then the Christians
 fired the first shot. By standing directly in front of the march of human
 progress, opposing justice and equality at every turn, denying science, and
 attempting to codify hate and oppression with laws that insult the success of
 democracy, they have brought this conflict upon themselves. But there is hope.
 If people of conscience armed with the invincible weapons of reason and
 compassion fight back against them, the Christians will lose this war. Don't
 hold back your criticism or fail to act out of "respect" for ideas that deserve
 ridicule - not reverence. The Christians have asked for this war, and too much
 is at stake for us to be idle.<br>-Jason Bachand</p>
<p>"Believing something is not an accomplishment. I grew up thinking that
 beliefs are something to be proud of, but they’re really nothing but opinions
 one refuses to reconsider. Beliefs are easy. The stronger your beliefs are, the
 less open you are to growth and wisdom, because “strength of belief” is only
 the intensity with which you resist questioning yourself. As soon as you are
 proud of a belief, as soon as you think it adds something to who you are, then
 you’ve made it a part of your ego. Listen to any “die-hard” conservative or
 liberal talk about their deepest beliefs and you are listening to somebody who
 will never hear what you say on any matter that matters to them — unless you
 believe the same. It is gratifying to speak forcefully, it is gratifying to be
 agreed with, and this high is what the die-hards are chasing. Wherever there is
 a belief, there is a closed door. Take on the beliefs that stand up to your
 most honest, humble scrutiny, and never be afraid to lose them."<br>
 -See The Perfection</p>
<p>"Yeah, we have souls, but they're made of neurons. And the little neurons,
 individually, are just blind little bio-robots. They don't know, they don't
 care, they're just doing their jobs. The amazing thing is that if you put
 enough of them together, in the right sort of teams, you have - basically - a
 soul. You have the control system and the memory of a being that can be held
 responsible; that can hold himself or herself responsible; that can look into
 the future."<br>-Dan Dennett</p>
<p>"Nothing can be more absurd than the idea that we can do something to please
 or displease an infinite Being. If our thoughts and actions can lessen or
 increase the happiness of God, then to that extent God is the slave and victim
 of man."<br>-Robert Ingersoll (1890)</p>
<p>"Whatever is inconsistent with the facts, no matter how fond of it we are,
 must be discarded or revised. Science is not perfect - it's often misused. It's
 only a tool, but it's the best tool we have; self-correcting, ever-changing,
 applicable to everything. With this tool, we vanquish the impossible."
<br>-Carl Sagan</p>
<p>"...I think Republicans are talking about abortion because they don't have
 anything constructive to say about any of our real problems. They're like a
 band who's been around for too long; they go on tour, they just play the
 Greatest Hits."<br>-Zac Little</p>
<p><b>&lt;roseknight#3079&gt;</b> so heres the real question: are these people willing
 to believe <i>anything</i> that happens to be a conspiracy theory and are
 thrilled by knowing 'The Truth' that the masses don't, or are they just looking
 for anything to justify their already-horrible views? because the latter is
 hard to fix, but the former could easily be... yknow, used to sway some of
 these dipshits in the <i>right</i> direction. with my-- i mean, anyone's, OWN
 cult.<br>
<b>&lt;roseknight#3079&gt;</b> the right direction being, of course, <i>my</i> political
 views, and also, giving <i>me</i> money</p>

Net Neutrality</legend><div><blockquote><p>
I am unsure how other countries do this, but in the US you pay an Internet
 Service Provider, ISP, to provide access to the internet. In most areas a
 single provider has traditionally had a monopoly. Although this is not as true
 as it used to be, your options are quite limited, the costs are high, and the
 service poor compared to the rest of the world, even many third world
 countries.</p><p>
But this ISP is paid by YOU to provide the Internet to YOU. But now the ISP
 wants to be able to sell access to you to internet content providers by giving
 you good access to sites that pay them and crappy access to those that don't.</p><p>
The concern about this is that internet will become dominated by sites that buy
 their dominance rather than earn it. Much of the US business is already
 dominated by large business that dominate the economy by buying political
 access. This will spread that to the internet. The largest ISPs have been
 giving large amounts of money to politicians to get this approved. The head of
 the regulatory agency involved, the FCC or Federal Communications Commission,
 is now headed by a former lobbyist for the country's largest ISP, Comcast.
 Besides wanting permission to sell access to you, Comcast wants to merge with
 the second largest ISP in the US. Both companies have terrible service
 reputations, but maintain market dominance through political connections.</p><p>
This policy is universally unpopular with citizens but their input is not really
 significant because political influence is primarily a matter of money in the
 US. The main opposition comes from other large companies that would be hurt by
 a stagnant internet. You would think that major content providers like google
 would favor this new system since it would allow them to buy a dominant
 position. But many of them oppose it because, like google, they make money by
 selling access to you to advertisers and are interested in maintaining a
 vibrant internet that will attract users to make their ads valuable. Companies
 such as google have the financial resources to compete with Comcast in the
 purchase of legislation and are our main hope in preventing this change. But
 things don't look good.</p></blockquote>/u/BillTowne
<p>"What the hell? I'm paying my ISP to deliver bits to me. I'm paying Netflix
 to deliver bits to me. Why the hell should Netflix also have to pay my ISP to
 deliver bits to me when I'm already paying both parties to deliver bits to me?
<br>[edit]If I paid for an Uber car to take me to a restaurant, and paid the
 restaurant for dinner, and then Uber tried to bill the restaurant for the
 privilege of getting my busines, nobody would question how insane the situation
 was. Yet it would be exactly the same situation as the ISPs are trying to
 impose on companies like Netflix. But once again, because it involves computers
 apparently lots of people's brains turn off the moment they try to think about
 this."<br>-Eurynom0s @ Ars Technica</p>

"What is the most shitty thing about becoming an adult?" (2014-02-27)
</legend><div><b>/u/calliope720's answer:</b><blockquote>
It's hard to explain, but for me it's that the sense of being part of some
 story where you are the protagonist kind of fizzles out unceremoniously and
 leaves you drifting for the rest of forever.<p>
As a kid, you're on a path, there's a plan laid out for you, and whether you
 intentionally break from the plan or follow it to the letter, there's this
 linear progression of growth, and an ultimate goal to strive for. You have
 allies, you have enemies, you have trials that you pass or fail, you have
 moments of catharsis, etc. You feel like part of a beautiful narrative, like
 the heroes in movies and books and tv shows and stories. You feel like there's
 a right and a wrong way to go, and some ultimate fate waiting for you at the
 end that will sum up what all of it meant.</p><p>
When you get to be an adult, that illusion crumbles away as you realize that
 you don't have a narrative, there is no path or plan, things aren't always
 linear, and you're nobody's hero. There are no allies, because friends can be
 both good and bad for you simultaneously. There are no enemies, because
 frankly no one cares enough to wage a personal war for long. You don't have a
 destiny. You make choices that are more a product of random chance than you
 want to admit, and sometimes the consequences make sense, sometimes they don't.
 You may flounder around in a bunch of different directions for many years,
 ultimately not making any progress, and having nothing of import to show for
 it. You're not a good person or an evil person - you're just an ant wandering
 around looking for crumbs. No, WORSE than an ant, because an ant has a purpose
 in life, to serve its queen and colony. You can choose to align yourself with a
 purpose, but it may never fulfill you or reward you. And nobody will be waiting
 with a shiny gold medal for you if you stick to it.</p><p>
Life as an adult seems less and less like an exciting adventure story and more
 and more like a delerious, confusing fog of random developments and passing
 phases that raise more questions than they answer.</p><p>
Edit: I somehow put my first edit in the middle of the text, which made it
 weird. But it said thank you very much for the gold and comments. I appreciate
 all the insights and solidarity, and the disagreement too.</p><p>
I haven't always felt this way about adulthood, and I probably won't always feel
 exactly this way. It's not as if everything's hopeless, or that I'll never try
 to find a direction for my life. It's just that the realization of how small
 your impact actually is, and that you are not destined for anything great, and
 how subject you are to forces bigger than yourself - that's a tough pill to
 swallow.</p><p>
Edit, Again: Reddit is full of some very kind, thoughtful, insightful humans.
 Many of us are going through the same thing, many people have words of
 encouragement to offer. I'm glad to be part of it with you guys.</p>

/u/_vargas_ wonders if any of this is real</legend><div>
Sometimes I think that I died at some point and just did not realize it.
<p>I would say that at least every other day, usually while driving, I get this
 feeling. Maybe that car didn't stop at the intersection but actually t-boned
 me. Maybe I briefly went over the center line and actually didn't get back in
 time before the oncoming truck hit me. I also live near an airport. Maybe a
 plane crashed after takeoff, fell on my house, and killed me in my sleep.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, my soul just didn't accept it. Like a movie theater
 projectionist switching reels, I continued on a path without realizing what
 happened. I try to notice these close calls when possible. I find myself
 looking in the rearview to make sure I don't see my car smashed to pieces at
 that last intersection.</p>
<p>I'm stuck here, but I can't prove it. There are people, though. They are all
 around. I think they are other souls that act to comfort or normalize my new
 life in this limbo. They exist in a radius around me, maybe 100 feet. When I
 look at people and cars going by in the distance, that's the living world. I'm
 in my own bubble.</p>
<p>Sure, there's new people I interact with besides the usual coworkers and
 friends, but I don't see these strangers interact with anyone outside my
 bubble. How do I know they aren't the same few spirits altering their
 appearance so as to appear different to me? Maybe they're trying to keep me in
 this limbo. The more I think about it, the more I realize that I only seem to
 meet about 7 or 8 truly different kinds of personalities. I swear I meet the
 same exact people, over and over. Everyone reminds me of someone I used to
 know.</p>
<p>As I'm typing this, I'm starting to freak out a bit as I notice more shit
 that supports my theory. I still have the same job. I still have the same car.
 I have the same asshole haircut. I have a piece of hair that grows out of a
 nipple but never gets any longer. My appearance hasn't changed in about four
 years. I should look more "weathered." I shouldn't still have gaps in
 facial/chest hair. I like to eat and barely work out, yet I stay at the same
 weight and always feel the same. I have a difficulty noticing the passing of
 time. Sometimes its fast, like minutes are stolen. Sometimes its slow, like I'm
 near a black hole.</p>
<p>It seems like everything stopped four years ago. I had a bit of a drinking
 problem that went hand-in-hand with a tumultuous relationship that was dying a
 slow death. I screamed at her once, saying i'd kill myself if she left me. We
 had been drinking all day. I stormed out in the middle of the night and drove
 two hours to my parents house. I moved out soon after that incident. Maybe I
 never made it. Maybe I died on the way there.</p>
<p>The dog! I took the dog with me when I stormed out that night! I still have
 the dog. He hasn't changed either. He was two when I moved out, so he's six
 now. But he doesn't look different. He's still hyper, like a two-year old dog
 would be.</p>
<p>I live by myself, now. Well, me and the dog. My neighbors barely talk to me.
 I walk the dog and people hardly acknowledge me. I thought it was because most
 of them are old and weary of strangers. Nobody even looks at us when they drive
 by.</p>
<p>Holy crap, I really think I may be dead. I killed myself and my dog after a
 drunken argument with my ex. I tried to drive 80 miles on winding, hilly roads
 in the middle of the night and I wrapped my car around a tree. So,its just me
 and the dog now. Until I can come to terms with my situation, like in The
 Others, I'm stuck in some kind of limbo. Awesome.</p>
 
<p><b>/u/Dark_Prism replied:</b></p><blockquote>
<p>I've thought about this from time to time. What if we never really die but
 just keep experiencing a slightly different timeline? What if every close call
 you've ever had was not a close call at all but a death, and because a
 conscious mind cannot accept non-existence it shifts itself in to another
 timeline?</p>
<p>I like to experience new things and see what's next, and so the thought of
 living forever (or at least a very long time) is appealing to me. But what if I
 do live forever? What if I am perpetually shifted out of timelines where I die?
 What if by the time I get to old age I've been shifted to a timeline where
 indefinite human life has become possible?</p>
<p>I want that to be what is really going on. The thought of my death rattles
 me. I'm not scared of being dead, I'm scared of missing out.</p></blockquote>

Maddox's take on the "glory days of the internet"</legend><div>
Though it's not near its peaks, my traffic is still pretty steady. Here's a
 secret about the Internet and its "glory days:" nobody really cares how often
 you update. People care about quality, not quantity of articles. Nobody cares
 that you posted 100 shitty posts on your blog. Nobody will remember the
 hundreds of shitty posts, but they will remember the 1 good one that made them
 laugh or think. All it takes is one article to spark someone's imagination, and
 to get them to say "hey, this shit's pretty good. You know what? I think I'll
 send this to my buddy..."<p>
The reason there are thousands of tumblr sites and countless photo blogs that
 don't get noticed is because most content creators don't self-edit. If it
 sucks, don't post it. Keep your brain farts to yourself. People who post every
 little quip or notion that pops into their head are assholes, because they're
 tacitly saying "fuck you" to the reader. They're saying "your time isn't as
 valuable as mine, so rather than me spending my time to edit down my content,
 I'll let you read it all and sift for good content for me." It's lazy. I edit
 myself into oblivion. Probably too much. I wrote or started to write 13
 articles last year, and only posted 1.</p><p>
As for the "glory days" of the Internet, you're living in them. Things are
 actually pretty good right now. After all, I'm still around. And yeah, I know I
 sound like a self-aggrandizing cock, but having a site titled "The Best Page in
 the Universe" doesn't lend itself to humility, and what more, it's the solid
 gold truth. It's telling that a guy like me--a self-made man who started out
 tinkering around with HTML and programming in his parents' basement--can make a
 living of his hobby, and challenge the status quo of media empires without
 selling out. My website was a shoestring operation for many years, completely
 funded by me, and when it blew up, I started getting more traffic than some of
 the biggest commercial sites out there. It's still completely self-funded, by
 the way. The Internet has finally given a voice to people who aren't rich or
 well-connected.</p></div></fieldset>

<br>II - UNDYING - Will not die of natural causes, but can be killed.
<br>III - REGENERATIVE - Vulnerable to injury, but recovers quickly.
<br>IV - RESSURECTIVE - Respawns or transfers into a different body.
<br>V - UNDEAD - Cannot be killed again.
<br>VI - IMMORTALITY ONLY - Will not die; vulnerable to normal injury, can age.
<br>VII - EXTERNAL - Conferred. Vampirism, demonic possession, soul jar, etc.
<br>VIII - LEGACY - Passes on their name and personality to sucessors.
<br>IX - PARASITIC - Soul transference to different bodies.
<br>X - VAMPIRIC - Feeds on life force of other living beings.
<br>XI - PROJECTED AVATAR - A reformable projection of an incorporeal entity.

Chuck Palahniuk: No 'Thought' Verbs (2013-08-03)</legend><div>
“In six seconds, you’ll hate me." But in six months, you’ll be a better writer.
<p>From this point forward—at least for the next half year—you may not use “thought” verbs. These include: Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires, and a hundred others you love to use.</p>
<p>The list should also include: Loves and Hates. And it should include: Is and Has, but we’ll get to those later.</p>
<p>Until some time around Christmas, you can’t write: Kenny wondered if Monica didn’t like him going out at night…”</p>
<p>Instead, you’ll have to Un-pack that to something like: “The mornings after Kenny had stayed out, beyond the last bus, until he’d had to bum a ride or pay for a cab and got home to find Monica faking sleep, faking because she never slept that quiet, those mornings, she’d only put her own cup of coffee in the microwave. Never his.”</p>
<p>Instead of characters knowing anything, you must now present the details that allow the reader to know them. Instead of a character wanting something, you must now describe the thing so that the reader wants it.</p>
<p>Instead of saying: “Adam knew Gwen liked him.” You’ll have to say: “Between classes, Gwen had always leaned on his locker when he’d go to open it. She’s roll her eyes and shove off with one foot, leaving a black-heel mark on the painted metal, but she also left the smell of her perfume. The combination lock would still be warm from her butt. And the next break, Gwen would be leaned there, again.”</p>
<p>In short, no more short-cuts. Only specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling.</p>
<p>Typically, writers use these “thought” verbs at the beginning of a paragraph (In this form, you can call them “Thesis Statements” and I’ll rail against those, later). In a way, they state the intention of the paragraph. And what follows, illustrates them.</p>
<p>For example: “Brenda knew she’d never make the deadline. Traffic was backed up from the bridge, past the first eight or nine exits. Her cell phone battery was dead. At home, the dogs would need to go out, or there would be a mess to clean up. Plus, she’d promised to water the plants for her neighbor…”</p>
<p>Do you see how the opening “thesis statement” steals the thunder of what follows? Don’t do it.</p>
<p>If nothing else, cut the opening sentence and place it after all the others. Better yet, transplant it and change it to: Brenda would never make the deadline.</p>
<p>Thinking is abstract. Knowing and believing are intangible. Your story will always be stronger if you just show the physical actions and details of your characters and allow your reader to do the thinking and knowing. And loving and hating.</p>
<p>Don’t tell your reader: “Lisa hated Tom.”</p>
<p>Instead, make your case like a lawyer in court, detail by detail.</p>
<p>Present each piece of evidence. For example: “During roll call, in the breath after the teacher said Tom’s name, in that moment before he could answer, right then, Lisa would whisper-shout ‘Butt Wipe,’ just as Tom was saying, ‘Here’.”</p>
<p>One of the most-common mistakes that beginning writers make is leaving their characters alone. Writing, you may be alone. Reading, your audience may be alone. But your character should spend very, very little time alone. Because a solitary character starts thinking or worrying or wondering.</p>
<p>For example: Waiting for the bus, Mark started to worry about how long the trip would take…”</p>
<p>A better break-down might be: “The schedule said the bus would come by at noon, but Mark’s watch said it was already 11:57. You could see all the way down the road, as far as the Mall, and not see a bus. No doubt, the driver was parked at the turn-around, the far end of the line, taking a nap. The driver was kicked back, asleep, and Mark was going to be late. Or worse, the driver was drinking, and he’d pull up drunk and charge Mark seventy-five cents for death in a fiery traffic accident…”</p>
<p>A character alone must lapse into fantasy or memory, but even then you can’t use “thought” verbs or any of their abstract relatives.</p>
<p>Oh, and you can just forget about using the verbs forget and remember.</p>
<p>No more transitions such as: “Wanda remembered how Nelson used to brush her hair.”</p>
<p>Instead: “Back in their sophomore year, Nelson used to brush her hair with smooth, long strokes of his hand.”</p>
<p>Again, Un-pack. Don’t take short-cuts.</p>
<p>Better yet, get your character with another character, fast. Get them together and get the action started. Let their actions and words show their thoughts. You—stay out of their heads.</p>
<p>And while you’re avoiding “thought” verbs, be very wary about using the bland verbs “is” and “have.”</p>
<p>For example: “Ann’s eyes are blue.”</p>
<p>“Ann has blue eyes.”</p>
<p>Versus:</p>
<p>“Ann coughed and waved one hand past her face, clearing the cigarette smoke from her eyes, blue eyes, before she smiled…”</p>
<p>Instead of bland “is” and “has” statements, try burying your details of what a character has or is, in actions or gestures. At its most basic, this is showing your story instead of telling it.</p>
<p>And forever after, once you’ve learned to Un-pack your characters, you’ll hate the lazy writer who settles for: “Jim sat beside the telephone, wondering why Amanda didn’t call.”</p>
<p>Please. For now, hate me all you want, but don’t use thought verbs. After Christmas, go crazy, but I’d bet money you won’t.</p>
<p>For this month’s homework, pick through your writing and circle every “thought” verb. Then, find some way to eliminate it. Kill it by Un-packing it.</p>
<p>Then, pick through some published fiction and do the same thing. Be ruthless.</p>
<p>“Marty imagined fish, jumping in the moonlight…”</p>
<p>“Nancy recalled the way the wine tasted…”</p>
<p>“Larry knew he was a dead man…”</p>
<p>Find them. After that, find a way to re-write them. Make them stronger.”</p>

So a while later the Oregonian pulls out a bottle of Henry Weinhard's 
River Road Ale. He opens it, takes a sip, takes another sip, then chugs 
the rest. He then puts the bottle back in his saddle bag, pulls out his 
gun, turns around and shoots the Californian. </p><p>
The Texan, shocked, says, "Why the heck did you do that!?" The Oregonian 
says, "Well, in Oregon, we have plenty of Californians, but bottles are 
worth a nickel."</p></div></fieldset>

Golf Balls</legend><div>
A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of 
him. When the class began, he wordlessly picked up a very large and empty 
mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the 
students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.
<p>The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He 
shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf 
balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.</p>
<p>The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of 
course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was 
full.. The students responded with a unanimous 'yes.'</p>
<p>The professor then produced two Beers from under the table and poured the 
entire contents into the jar effectively filling the empty space between the 
sand. The students laughed..</p>
<p>'Now,' said the professor as the laughter subsided, 'I want you to recognize 
that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important 
things---your family, your children, your health, your friends and your 
favorite passions---and if everything else was lost and only they remained, 
your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter 
like your job, your house and your car.. The sand is everything else---the 
small stuff.</p>
<p>'If you put the sand into the jar first,' he continued, 'there is no room for 
the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life.</p>
<p>If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have 
room for the things that are important to you.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.</p>
<p>Spend time with your children. Spend time with your parents. Visit with 
grandparents. Take your spouse out to dinner. Play another 18. There will 
always be time to clean the house and mow the lawn.</p>
<p>Take care of the golf balls first---the things that really matter. Set your 
priorities. The rest is just sand.</p>
<p>One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the Beer represented. The 
professor smiled and said, 'I'm glad you asked.' The Beer just shows you that 
no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of 
Beers with a friend.</p></div></fieldset>

The Male Perspective</legend><div>
We always hear "the rules" from the female side.<br>
Now here are the Rules from the male side.<br>
These are our rules! Please note... these are all Numbered "1" ON PURPOSE!
<ol>
<li value=1>
Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. 
    We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you 
    leaving it down.</li><li value=1>
Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it.
    That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.</li><li value=1>
A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.</li><li value=1>
Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. 
    In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.</li><li value=1>
If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, 
    don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.</li><li value=1>
Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. 
    Let it be.</li><li value=1>
Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.
</li><li value=1>Crying is blackmail.</li><li value=1>
Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not
    work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!
</li><li value=1>Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question..
</li><li value=1>If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.
</li><li value=1>If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways
    makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.</li><li value=1>
You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done.
    Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.
</li><li value=1>Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.
</li><li value=1>Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.
</li><li value=1>ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. 
    Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. 
    We have no idea what mauve is.</li><li value=1>
If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.</li><li value=1>
If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's 
    wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.</li><li value=1>
If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer 
    you don't want to hear.</li><li value=1>
When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine. Really.
</li><li value=1>
Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss 
    such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.
</li><li value=1>You have enough clothes.</li><li value=1>You have too many shoes.
</li><li value=1>I am in shape. Round is a shape.</li></ol><p>
Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch
    tonight, but did you know men really don't mind that, it's like camping..
</p><p>Pass this to as many men as you can - to give them a laugh.<br>
Pass this to as many women as you can - to give them an education!!

Governmentium</legend><div>
New research has led to the discovery of the heaviest element yet known to 
science. The new element, Governmentium (Gv), has one neutron, 25 assistant 
neutrons, 88 deputy neutrons, and 198 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an 
atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together by forces called 
morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called 
peons. Since Governmentium has no electrons, it is inert; however, it can be 
detected, because it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. A 
minute amount of Governmentium can cause a reaction that would normally take 
less than a second to take from four days to four years to complete.
<p>Governmentium has a normal half-life of 5 years; It does not decay, but instead 
undergoes a reorganization in which a portion of the assistant neutrons and 
deputy neutrons exchange places. In fact, Governmentium's mass will actually 
increase over time, since each reorganization will cause more morons to become 
neutrons, forming isodopes. This characteristic of moron promotion leads some 
scientists to believe that Governmentium is formed whenever morons reach a 
critical level of concentration.</p>
<p>This hypothetical quantity is referred to as critical morass. When catalyzed 
with money, Governmentium becomes Administratium, an element that radiates just 
as much energy as Governmentium since it has half as many peons but twice as 
many morons.</p></div></fieldset>

Steven Wright</legend><div>
If you're not familiar with the work of Steven Wright, he's the famously 
erudite scientist and comic who once said: "I woke up one morning and all of 
my stuff had been stolen... and replaced by exact duplicates." His mind sees 
things differently from most of us, to our amazement and amusement.
<p>Here are some of his gems:</p>
<ol><li>I'd kill for a Nobel Peace Prize.
</li><li>Borrow money from pessimists. They don't expect it back.
</li><li>Half the people you know are below average.
</li><li>99% of lawyers give the rest a bad name.
</li><li>82.7% of all statistics are made up on the spot.
</li><li>A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good.
</li><li>A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.
</li><li>If you want the rainbow, you got to put up with the rain.
</li><li>All those who believe in psychokinesis, raise my hand.
</li><li>The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
</li><li>I almost had a psychic girlfriend, but she left me before we met.
</li><li>OK, so what's the speed of dark?
</li><li>How do you tell when you're out of invisible ink?
</li><li>If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked 
      something.
</li><li>Depression is merely anger without enthusiasm.
</li><li>When everything is coming your way, you're in the wrong lane.
</li><li>Ambition is a poor excuse for not having enough sense to be lazy.
</li><li>Hard work pays off in the future; laziness pays off now.
</li><li>I intend to live forever......so far, so good.
</li><li>If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends?
</li><li>Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.
</li><li>What happens if you get scared half to death twice?
</li><li>My mechanic told me, "I couldn't repair your brakes, so I made your horn 
      louder."
</li><li>Why do psychics have to ask you for your name?
</li><li>If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried.
</li><li>A conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking.
</li><li>Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.
</li><li>The hardness of the butter is proportional to the softness of the bread.
</li><li>To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism; to steal from many is 
      research.
</li><li>The problem with the gene pool is that there is no lifeguard.
</li><li>The sooner you fall behind, the more time you'll have to catch up.
</li><li>The colder the x-ray table, the more of your body is required to be on it.

The English Language</legend><div>
Let's face it -- English is a crazy language. There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple. English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France. Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.
<p>We take English for granted. But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.</p>
<p>And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham? If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth beeth? One goose, 2 geese. So one moose, 2 meese?</p>
<p>Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend, that you comb through annals of history but not a single annal? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?</p>
<p>If teachers taught, why didn't preacher praught? If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? If you wrote a letter, perhaps you bote your tongue?</p>
<p>Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? Ship by truck and send cargo by ship? Have noses that run and feet that smell? Park on driveways and drive on parkways?</p>
<p>How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and wise guy are opposites? How can overlook and oversee be opposites, while quite a lot and quite a few are alike? How can the weather be hot as hell one day and cold as hell another.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that we talk about certain things only when they are absent? Have you ever seen a horseful carriage or a strapful gown? Met a sung hero or experienced requited love? Have you ever run into someone who was combobulated, gruntled, ruly or peccable? And where are all
those people who ARE spring chickens or who would ACTUALLY hurt a fly?</p>
<p>You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which an alarm clock goes off by going on.</p>
<p>English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race (which, of course, isn't a race at all).  That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible. And why, when I wind up my watch, I start it, but when I wind up this essay, I end it.</p>

Diamonds</legend><div>
<p>Due to extensive research done by the University of Pittsburgh, diamond has
 been confirmed as the hardest metal known to man. The research is as follows.
 Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into
 it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed. They then built a wall out
 of diamond and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the
 wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a diamond car made of 400
 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles
 per hour into a diamond traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless
 for hours. They rammed a wall of metal into a 400 mile per hour made of
 diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth’s orbit 400 million
 miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small
 Washington suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Prussia at 400 billion
 miles per hour. They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls
 per hour, and as a result caused two wayward airplanes to lose track of their
 bearings, and make a fatal crash with two buildings in downtown New York. They
 spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive.
 Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall
 traveling at miles per iron, and the result proved without a doubt that
 diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not just the hardest metal
 known to man.</p></div></fieldset>

Lessons Learned in Life</legend><div><ul>
<li>I've learned that if someone says something unkind about me, I must live my
 life so that no one would believe it.</li><li>I've learned that you can make
 someone's day by simply sending them a little note.</li><li>I've learned that
 the greater a person's sense of guilt, the greater his or her need to cast the
 blame on others.</li><li>I've learned that no matter what happens, or how bad
 it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow.</li><li>I've
 learned that making a "living" is not the same thing as making a life.</li><li>
 I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance.</li><li>I've
 learned that if you pursue happiness, it will elude you.  But if you focus on
 your family, your friends, your work, and doing the very best you can,
 happiness will find you.</li><li>I've learned that whenever I decide something
 with an open heart, I usually make the right decision.</li><li>I've learned
 that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one.</li><li>I've learned that
 everyday you should reach out and touch someone.  People love that human touch
 - holding hands, a warm hug, or just a friendly pat on the back.</li><li>I've
 learned that I still have so very much more to learn!</li></ul></div></fieldset>
